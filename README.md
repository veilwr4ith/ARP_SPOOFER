This simple Python script facilitates ARP spoofing attacks on local networks. ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a technique used by attackers to intercept network traffic between two hosts by sending fake ARP messages to each host. This tool can be employed for various purposes, including network reconnaissance, man-in-the-middle attacks, or security testing. It's crucial to use this script responsibly and only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scapy library (`pip install scapy`)
